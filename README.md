# PYMINT
~~an encryption method that's incredibly strong, secure enough to beat out sha256 encryption~~ no it isn't
# USAGE
Generate a key using an expected string for the output to align to<br>
without the key you can not decrypt or encrypt ANYTHING<br>
a key is only as big as its expect string<br>
a key is comprised of 2 things<br>
a 4 character code and the character its meant to be<br>
these codes are then broken away from their chars and merged to create the encrypted message<br>
its simple enough that theres only 3 functions<br>
# New Method
<h2>
  The new method is less complicated, is more compact, and is far faster. Please use it instead.
</h2>Needs a string to encode, a rotation factor, and a seed.<br> the seed can be an int or string.
